# Extract-cxserver-configuration-and-export-to-CSV
This is my submission to the task #T331201.

This is a Python script that extracts the supported language pairs from CXServer configuration files and exports them to a CSV file.

# Requirements
 Python 
 PyYAML module
 OS module
 CSV module
 
# Usage
 1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
 2. Install all the necessary module.
 3. Open the extract_config.py file in a text editor.
 4. Modify the CONFIG_DIR variable in line 10 to point to the directory containing the CXServer configuration files.
 5. Run the script to execute the file.
 6. The script will generate a file named supported_pairs.csv in the same directory as the extract.py file.
