# Extract-cxserver-configuration-and-export-to-CSV
This is my submission to the task #T331201. 

This is a Python script that extracts the supported language pairs from CXServer configuration files and exports them to a CSV file.

Requirements
Python
PyYAML module

# Usage
 1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
 2. Install PyYAML module by running the following command:
     pip install pyyaml
     
 3. Open the extract.py file in a text editor.
   Modify the CONFIG_DIR variable in line 10 to point to the directory containing the CXServer configuration files.
 4. Run the script by executing the following command in the terminal:
    python extract.py 
    
 5. The script will generate a file named supported_pairs.csv in the same directory as the extract.py file.
